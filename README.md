# EventHive
This is a small ticket selling and buying platform. It works on a micro-service based arcitecture that all combined provide a platform to sell tickets, place orders and make real-time payments for them.

## Application Features

- Autherise a user to sell and buy tickets.
- See all the tickets that are available to purchase.
- See all the orders a user has created.
- On attempt to purchase a ticket provide a 1 minute window to make payment, else cancel the order.
- Keep track of all the payments and their corresponding orders.

## Design overview

To achieve this application requirement in a way that the application is easily scalable and less coupled on these features we followed a micro-service architecture based approach. 

All in all we have implemented 5 different services exposed for each type of requirement.

- `Authentication Service`: Autherization related business logic.
- `Server Side Rendered Client`: For SEO and less client side depended rendering we used a server side client that renders the required components and their data and sends it over to the actual client.
- `Tickets Service`: Ticket CRUD operation business logic.
- `Orders Service`: Orders CRUD operation business logic.
- `Payments Service`: Payment operation business logic.

Internally have further 2 services that support the application and extends other features and communications between different services.

- `Expiration Service`: Monitors the created orders and handles expiration events on these orders.
- `NATS streaming server`: An event bus for fluent communication between different services.

To avoid duplication of middlewares, error handlers and event interfaces, npm package is created which holds this common code to all the services.

- `Common Module`: Holds the reusable code for different services. It is published as a npm package. It is a sub-module to this repository. Actual repository for it can be found [here](https://github.com/Pranshu-Tripathi/Event-Hive-Common)

Third Party library

- `react-stripe-checkout`: Used for retrieving API based payment tokens from stripe.com and then storing them in payment service.
